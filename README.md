# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview 
### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to use python and pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using that Dataframe, a multiple-line graph was created to show the total weekly fares for each city type for comparison. The CEO will be able to use this data to address disparities among the different city types.
## Results

### Rural
The Rural fares started at the lowest cost of about $200 and stayed pretty level from January to the end of April. There were slight spikes at the end of Febuary and the begining of April as shown in the graph. 
### Suburban
Suburban fares remainen the middle starting with a total fare of about $700. There wes a slight spike in the end of febuary and a dip early April, but the total fare stayed fairly steaky in the given time frame. 
### Urban 
Urban fairs had the highest average starting at about $1,700. The fare price grew from January to the end of Febuary where it then had an up and down rend throughout March as shown in the image above. 
## Sumary 
In summary, Rural, Suburban and Urban city types had fares going from lowest to highest respectivley. I recommend the following buisness strategies to be considered based on this information: 
* Opportunity to expend buisness and marketing in rural and suburban areas to attract more customers and drivers.
* Aquiring larger cars in Urban areas so passangers are more inclined to ride together and use our transportation option as opposed to cheaper alternatives. 
* Investigate fare pricing in rural areas.
